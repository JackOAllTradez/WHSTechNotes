Reflecting on Python...
My experience with Python so far is quite alright. It's simple enough, considering I already know Java, and I have plenty of resources if I ever happen to struggle. Speaking of struggling, I've had some trouble with the Graphics Unit on Project Stem. Why did no one warm me that simplegui was so complicated? That's just mean. I won't give up yet, though. The way I see it, if I give up, I'm showing weakness.

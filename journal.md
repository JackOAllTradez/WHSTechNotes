  Today I created my journal on GitHub. Horray!!

  Reflecting on Python...
  My experience with Python so far is quite alright. It's simple enough, considering I already know Java, and I have plenty of resources if I ever happen to struggle. Speaking of struggling, I've had some trouble with the Graphics Unit on Project Stem. Why did no one warm me that simplegui was so complicated? That's just mean. I won't give up yet, though. The way I see it, if I give up, I'm showing weakness.

  I gave up on graphics and I'm glad I did. Functions and lists are far more important if I get into a computer science career. Either way, I need to write something for my weekly journal grade. I finished functions and passed the test with 20 points out of 20 points. Hurray! Graphics held me back, but I'm flying through the units again.
  Also, for the actual prompt that I never looked at... The journal creation instructions was perfect. I followed them to the letter and I did everything right. The only problem was that you had me make my GitHub account early and I gave you my username on a sticky note. You ended up losing it, so I had to give you my username again via the username form.

  Today, I tried my darndest to fix my journal in GitHub. I wish to fight the grading bot.

  Following instructions exactly as they're given is extremely important in programing. Depending on thew programming language, neglecting to follow instructions could break your computer. It is important to be efficient, accurate, and use proper language. That goes for formal language, such as programming, **and** natural language, like what we use to speak.

  I never used the Sphero Bolt robots or block code, so I will compare Python to Java, instead. Java feels more professional than Python, and according to my past teacher, Mr. Fenoglio, it has more capabilities than Python does. However, all the most practical abilities are in Python, so for many, there's no reason to learn Java. I learned Java first, and decided to learn Python because it is considered easier and less strict in how it's written.

  Computer science is responsible for many things, such as my coping skills, my luck, and my daily torture, all of which happen to involve video games in some way, shape, or form. For example, when I play Project Sekai, my rate for drawing a good character card is crummy at best, but in Cookie Run Kingdom, my luck is significantly better. In fact, I drew one of the Ancient rarity cookies this morning in my 1st period. Naturally, all this gambling (I'm F2P I swear) is my coping mechanism. Without computer science, these games wouldn't exist.

I researched Cybersecurity Analysts, which are the first line of defense against cyber crimes. They protect computer networks against cyberattacks and unathorized access, which keeps personal data safe. To be a cybersecurity analyst, you would need to know either JavaScrpt, Python, or C/C++. You don't need a specific education to get a job as a Cybersecurity Analyst, but majority of people in this field have a Bachelors degree. This job doesn't align with my goals in computer science because I don't want a computer science career. I'm only in this pathway because my mom wanted me to be like my brother.

Coding improves problem solving skills because when programming, you often come across errors, which you will then need to troubleshoot. This applies to real life because you will frequently encounter unforseen issues in the workplace. For example, in economics, you can get rid of a recessionary gap by increasing government spending or decreasing taxes, but you could also do both. However, you might do a bit too much of one or the other and end up in an inflationary gap. Now you have a new, unforseen issue to solve.

AI can be a very helpful tool, especially to programmers who don't have the time to write every single 'if' and 'for' by themselves. Thinks like ChatGPT can be useful for organizing thoughts, getting quick answers, and boosting creativity. However, they can also cause harm when they hack into private information, steal art, and give misinformation. This duality tends to confuse the public and makes them wonder if AI is good or bad, and they end up missing the big picture. AI is neither good nor bad, because the responsibility lies in the people who developed it. It's less about destroying AI to solve the problem, and more about improving it and adding some 'barriers' that it can't cross. AI shouldn't create art or write stories using the work of others, but it makes no sense why we should stop it as a whole when it also helps people gather their thoughts and work more efficiently.

Using technology in the election is both genius and idiotic. It can count votes quickly and accurately without making human mistakes, however, it can also be hacked or rigged by people both inside and outside whatever company owns the technology. People are biased, and that bias could show in the results without anyone realizing that it was planned from the start.

Private information is private because with it, someone can steal your identity both online and in real life. As one might guess, this can ruin a person's life. That's why protecting private information is important. Never share anything online. Make sure you have a professional email and a private email, that way your professional email can be for official things like your bank account and your private email can be for less important things like youtube. This will keep all your private information on your professional email, which will only be used for things that need your information.

I hate the world and cannot think of a single current event that interests me. People suck and we've ruined our own world with our foolish politics, wars, and desire for larger cities. The most interesting current event is the election, but no sane person would share their thoughts on it.

Technology is responsible for pretty much everything humanity has. Our homes, our jobs, and our food revolve around it. Our food would be ugly and unappetizing if it weren't for technology. Science was used to make it brighter, tastier, and more nutrient-packed.

Artifical Intelliegence (AI) is a very useful tool for those who are responsible enough to utilize it properly. I've experienced both positive and negative effects of AI, but the one I'm about to experience, is one of the positive ones. My mom's best friend's daughter is deaf, and she recently got an AI program on her phone that translates spoken words into text that she can read. This is an incredible use of AI, because it improved the quality of an honorary family-member's life.

Brain rot is a term I use frequently, both ironically and unironically. Sometimes, it's negative, like when someone hyperfocuses on a screen rather than the content shown on said screen. Other times, it's significantly more positive, referring to a specific topic that someone enjoys and could talk about for hours and hours. For me, it's clowns, but for others, it's a specific sound, such as sheet metal, or a unique animal, such as the platypus. This is positive because interesting subjects and sounds can bring people together. One of my closest friends is my friend because we both love clowns, and it happens to be a fun fact my teachers never forget, even after I leave their class. Lore is another term I use frequently, most often when referring to games with deep storylines or hidden easter eggs, such as Skyrim, Cookie Run Kingdom, or Genshin Impact.

Yes, I am. I successfully convinced my mother to let me sleep in on at least two of the days, and even clarified that I mean "until 2PM", not "until 9AM". I've had a roommate for the past week, and as much as I adore him, I need him and his family to leave so I can relax.

Last semester was... Messy. I had to hide in the back, most frequently with the lights off, so I could properly shut out all the outside racket. I already have minimal motivation to work, but the other folks don't help. How can someone have that strong of an aversion to effort? This semester, I would like to expand on the "hiding" part. can I pitch a tent in the office? I'm joking, of course. I just want to complete my portfolio and do certifications for Python and Java.

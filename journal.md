  Today I created my journal on GitHub. Horray!!

  Reflecting on Python...
  My experience with Python so far is quite alright. It's simple enough, considering I already know Java, and I have plenty of resources if I ever happen to struggle. Speaking of struggling, I've had some trouble with the Graphics Unit on Project Stem. Why did no one warm me that simplegui was so complicated? That's just mean. I won't give up yet, though. The way I see it, if I give up, I'm showing weakness.

  I gave up on graphics and I'm glad I did. Functions and lists are far more important if I get into a computer science career. Either way, I need to write something for my weekly journal grade. I finished functions and passed the test with 20 points out of 20 points. Hurray! Graphics held me back, but I'm flying through the units again.
  Also, for the actual prompt that I never looked at... The journal creation instructions was perfect. I followed them to the letter and I did everything right. The only problem was that you had me make my GitHub account early and I gave you my username on a sticky note. You ended up losing it, so I had to give you my username again via the username form.

  Today, I tried my darndest to fix my journal in GitHub. I wish to fight the grading bot.

  Following instructions exactly as they're given is extremely important in programing. Depending on thew programming language, neglecting to follow instructions could break your computer. It is important to be efficient, accurate, and use proper language. That goes for formal language, such as programming, **and** natural language, like what we use to speak.

  I never used the Sphero Bolt robots or block code, so I will compare Python to Java, instead. Java feels more professional than Python, and according to my past teacher, Mr. Fenoglio, it has more capabilities than Python does. However, all the most practical abilities are in Python, so for many, there's no reason to learn Java. I learned Java first, and decided to learn Python because it is considered easier and less strict in how it's written.

  Computer science is responsible for many things, such as my coping skills, my luck, and my daily torture, all of which happen to involve video games in some way, shape, or form. For example, when I play Project Sekai, my rate for drawing a good character card is crummy at best, but in Cookie Run Kingdom, my luck is significantly better. In fact, I drew one of the Ancient rarity cookies this morning in my 1st period. Naturally, all this gambling (I'm F2P I swear) is my coping mechanism. Without computer science, these games wouldn't exist.
